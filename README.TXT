#32 Yes, the clear operation should be setting the previousOperator = to ' '. In case it still prints 
    the right result, making it an error that would be hard to spot on the first try. 

#33 I think the right amount is shown to fully see what the program is doing. 

#34 In a larger program, there would be so many print statements that it becomes useless to be wasting 
    time reading through all of it. That being said it is also a good way of seeing exaclty what changes 
    after each method call which I think is very useful.
